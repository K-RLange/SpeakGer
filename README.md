# SpeakGer
This GitHub-repository provides an overview of the functions used to create the "SpeakGer" data set. It consists of a total of ... speeches of German politicians from the German Bundestag as well as all 16 German federal state parliaments from 1946 to 2023. We aim to update this data set on a regular basis so that the plenary sessions are always up to date.
